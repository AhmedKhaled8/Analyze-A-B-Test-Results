# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

**This is the second project in the 'Advanced Data Analysis' nanodegree provided by FWD-Egypt.

We have a data set that contains results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
